Overview
--------

Agentic RAG is a sophisticated multi-agent system that combines the power of:

* **CrewAI Framework**: Orchestrates multiple AI agents working collaboratively
* **Qdrant Vector Database**: High-performance vector similarity search with hybrid capabilities
* **Azure OpenAI**: Advanced language models for generation and embeddings
* **RAGAS Evaluation**: Comprehensive RAG system evaluation framework
* **Streamlit Interface**: User-friendly web interface for interaction

Key Features
------------

ü§ñ **Multi-Agent Architecture**
   - **Check Crew**: Validates query relevance and determines appropriate search strategy
   - **Web Search Crew**: Performs web searches when local knowledge is insufficient  
   - **Synthesis Crew**: Combines information from multiple sources into coherent responses

üîç **Advanced Search Capabilities**
   - Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching
   - Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) for result diversification
   - Multi-sector document indexing (Banking, Energy, etc.)

üìä **Comprehensive Evaluation**
   - RAGAS framework integration for RAG evaluation
   - Metrics: Context Precision, Context Recall, Faithfulness, Answer Relevancy
   - Automated evaluation pipeline with CSV reporting

üåê **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Streamlit web application for easy interaction
   - Real-time query processing and response generation
   - Sector-specific search options
