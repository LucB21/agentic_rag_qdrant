# RAG System Improvements Summary

## Overview
I've successfully improved your RAG system functions and created comprehensive input-output examples for Opik custom rules. Here's what was accomplished:

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced `rag_tool` Function
**Before**: Returned only a string (context)
**After**: Returns structured dictionary with comprehensive metadata

```python
# New return structure
{
    "status": "success|no_results|error",
    "question": str,
    "context": str,
    "sources": [{"id", "source", "score", "text_preview"}],
    "retrieval_scores": [float],
    "context_chunks": [{"id", "source", "text", "score"}],
    "num_results": int,
    "avg_score": float,
    "max_score": float,
    "error": str (if applicable)
}
```

### 2. Improved `rag_search` Function
**Before**: Inconsistent return structure, poor error handling
**After**: Structured response with comprehensive metadata and proper error handling

```python
# New return structure
{
    "question": str,
    "sector": [str],
    "retrieval_metadata": {
        "status": str,
        "num_results": int,
        "avg_score": float,
        "max_score": float,
        "sources": [...]
    },
    "context": str,
    "generated_answer": str,
    "context_chunks": [...],
    "timestamp": str,
    "flow_step": str,
    "error": str (if applicable)
}
```

### 3. Enhanced `save_response` Function
**Before**: Minimal functionality, no proper file handling
**After**: Comprehensive file saving with both JSON and Markdown reports

```python
# New return structure (enhanced payload)
{
    # ... all previous fields ...
    "saved_files": {
        "json_response": str,
        "markdown_report": str
    },
    "save_timestamp": str,
    "flow_step": "response_saved"
}
```

## Opik Custom Rules Examples

I've created 5 comprehensive custom rule examples:

### 1. Retrieval Quality Evaluation
- **Purpose**: Evaluate document retrieval relevance and diversity
- **Metrics**: Number of results, similarity scores, source diversity
- **Input**: Retrieval metadata from `rag_tool`
- **Output**: Quality score with detailed breakdown

### 2. Answer Completeness Check
- **Purpose**: Validate generated answer quality and structure
- **Metrics**: Answer length, source citations, question relevance
- **Input**: Complete RAG response from `rag_search`
- **Output**: Completeness score with specific feedback

### 3. Error Handling Evaluation
- **Purpose**: Assess system robustness and graceful degradation
- **Metrics**: Error handling, informative messages, system stability
- **Input**: Error responses or no-results scenarios
- **Output**: Reliability score with error analysis

### 4. Response Structure Validation
- **Purpose**: Ensure all required fields are present and properly typed
- **Metrics**: Field completeness, data type compliance, file operations
- **Input**: Final response from `save_response`
- **Output**: Structure validation score

### 5. End-to-End Quality Assessment
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive evaluation combining all aspects
- **Metrics**: Overall performance, recommendations, trend analysis
- **Input**: Complete flow output
- **Output**: Overall quality score with actionable recommendations

## Data Flow Improvements

### Before (Issues)
- Inconsistent return types
- Poor error handling
- Limited metadata for evaluation
- No structured logging

### After (Solutions)
- Consistent structured returns at every step
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- Rich metadata for Opik evaluation
- Detailed logging and file saving

## Example Input-Output Pairs

Each rule includes:
- **Clear Input Example**: Realistic JSON data from your improved functions
- **Expected Output**: Opik rule result with scores and details
- **Rule Logic**: Python implementation showing how to evaluate the data
- **Metrics**: Quantifiable measures for performance tracking

## Benefits for Opik Integration

1. **Rich Data**: Every function now provides structured, evaluable data
2. **Multiple Evaluation Points**: Rules can be applied at different flow stages
3. **Comprehensive Metrics**: From retrieval quality to answer completeness
4. **Error Tracking**: System robustness and failure mode analysis
5. **Trend Analysis**: Performance monitoring over time

## Implementation Ready

Your improved RAG system is now ready for:
- ✅ Opik custom rule implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive performance evaluation
- ✅ Automated quality assessment
- ✅ Continuous improvement tracking
- ✅ Production monitoring

The structured data flow ensures that every aspect of your RAG system can be measured, evaluated, and improved systematically.
