What does LULUCF regulate?;LULUCF regulates the emissions and removals of CO2 derived from land use, land-use change, and forestry within the EU's 2030 energy and climate framework. It requires EU member states to ensure that emissions from land use are fully compensated by equivalent CO2 removals through actions in the sector, such as offsetting deforestation emissions with carbon sinks from reforestation or improved sustainable forest management. The regulation covers all managed lands, including forests, croplands, grasslands, and wetlands, and aims to maintain the EU soil's current status of absorbing more CO2 than it emits [source:C:\Users\NG448ES\OneDrive - EY\Desktop\EY - privata\Academy\deposito_battaglione\agentic_rag_qdrant\document\energia.md].;It includes emissions and removals from land use, forestry, and agriculture in the 2030 framework.;0.9999999999;0.0;1.0;0.9453559893737955;0.4066532033014536
What must Member States ensure under LULUCF?;Under the LULUCF regulation, Member States must ensure that the emissions accounted for from land use are fully compensated by an equivalent removal of CO2 from the atmosphere through actions in the sector. This includes compensating emissions from activities such as deforestation with equivalent carbon sinks created through reforestation or improved sustainable management of existing forests [source:C:\Users\NG448ES\OneDrive - EY\Desktop\EY - privata\Academy\deposito_battaglione\agentic_rag_qdrant\document\energia.md].;That emissions are offset by equivalent CO2 removals (e.g. reforestation).;0.7499999999625;1.0;1.0;0.9304868813174529;0.6527551456183207
