James Naismith is credited with the invention of basketball. To create the sport, he wrote its basic rules and initially nailed a peach basket onto a 10-foot (3.05 m) elevated track. Unlike modern basketball nets, the peach basket had a bottom, requiring balls to be manually retrieved after each point scored. This inefficiency was later addressed by removing the basket's bottom and using a long dowel to poke out the balls after each score. Basketball, at its inception, was played with a soccer ball, and the equipment evolved over time. While the first basketballs were brown, a more visible orange ball was developed in the late 1950s by Tony Hinkle. 

This foundational effort by Naismith was the beginning of what has since become a globally iconic sport.
