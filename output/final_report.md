  "answer": "The EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), established in 2005, is the worldâ€™s first international emissions trading system and is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner through the 'cap and trade' principle. According to internal documents and trusted web sources, the ETS covers multiple sectors, including:\n\n1. **Electricity and Heat Generation**: This sector includes central power stations and facilities producing heat for industrial or residential use.\n\n2. **Energy-Intensive Industries**: Examples include oil refineries, steel works, aluminum production, and industries producing cement, lime, glass, ceramics, pulp, paper, cardboard, acids, and organic chemicals.\n\n3. **Aviation**: Emissions from aviation were included in 2012, covering flights operating within the European Economic Area (EEA).\n\n4. **Maritime Transport**: Starting from 2024, emissions from ships will also be covered under the ETS.\n\n5. **Buildings and Road Transport**: Recent policy revisions introduced separate trading systems for emissions originating from buildings and road transport.\n\n6. **Land Use and Removal**: Member states can use a limited number of carbon removal credits linked to land use to achieve reductions.\n\nNotable updates include the tightening of the EU-wide reduction target to 62% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, emphasizing the accelerated reduction of emissions from these sectors. Additionally, the EU ETS has achieved a reduction of emissions for covered sectors by approximately 50% since its inception.\n\nWhile internal documents give a detailed view of the sectors covered and mechanisms implemented, trusted web sources further complement this information by describing recent expansions and policy updates. Supplementary insights from untrusted sources, such as ICAP and Sweep.net, discuss related mechanisms like the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and emphasize the potential inclusion of other emissions sources, such as hydrogen production and fertilizers. However, these are marked as supplementary and not authoritative.",
