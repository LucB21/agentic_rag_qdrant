  "answer": "The Emissions Trading System (ETS), established in 2005, is an international initiative aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions through a cap-and-trade mechanism. According to the internal documents, the EU ETS initially covered around 11,000 power plants and large-scale industrial facilities across all EU countries, including Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway, representing approximately 45% of the EU's total greenhouse gas emissions. Key sectors under its coverage include energy production and major industries such as cement, steel, aluminum, manufacturing, and aviation, which was integrated in 2012. The directive supporting ETS has been revised to introduce measures such as an EU-wide cap on emissions, progressing towards auctions instead of free allocation of allowances, and greater sectorial and gas inclusion. Additional trusted web sources specify that newer developments under ETS2 expand the scope to road transport and buildings, demonstrating the system's evolving and comprehensive inclusion of high-emission sectors. Categories such as hydrogen production and fertilizers are also acknowledged due to their high emissions and capacity for precise monitoring. Globally, other ETS frameworks, such as China's, are also incorporating similar high-emitting sectors like cement, steel, and aluminum, providing evidence of harmonized sector coverage worldwide.",
